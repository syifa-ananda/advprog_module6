## Commit 1 Reflection

In this milestone, I built a simple Rust web server that listens for TCP connections at `127.0.0.1:7878`. I started by printing a message each time a client connected, then moved the connection handling into its own function to keep the code organized. I also learned how to deal with multiple requests and fix small warnings. This hands-on experience made the inner workings of a web server much clearer and set the stage for future improvements.
